Wheel of Fortune Puzzle Assignment 

The player must choose one of three categories. A puzzle is then selected
from that category and presented to the player. If the puzzle contains ‘R’, ‘S’, ‘T’, ‘L’, ‘N’, or ‘E’, these
letters are revealed. The player must then choose three consonants and a vowel. If the player entered
the Bonus Round with a wildcard, an additional consonant must be chosen. The consonants and vowel
chosen by the player are inserted in the puzzle if they are present and the player must then guess the
puzzle.
In the television show, the player is given ten seconds to guess the puzzle. In this assignment, there is
no time constraint, and the player is simply given three tries to guess the puzzle. If the player correctly
guesses the puzzle, he/she wins a prize (typically, a car, $40,000.00, or the jackpot of $100,000.00).
